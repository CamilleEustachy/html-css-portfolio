<h1>The best movies according to God</h1>
<h2>The top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Le Grand bleu</h3>
<p>Perfectly perfect if you want to take a bath in the depths of the ocean. The sound effects and the music are just insane. You will like it for sure, although God has to admit that it is kinda sexist. But give it a try.</p>
<h3>Howl's moving castle</h3>
<p>Studio Ghibli's artistic graphism at the peak. The story, inspired by the same-named book written by Dianna Wynne Jones -not sure of the name?- is a pure jewel. Try it. And when you are at it, just watch all the studio ghibli movies. Yeah you read it right. It's a command.</p>
<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>Okay I know I'm cheating with this one, but first i'm god I created the world so YOU are cheating and second this serie is so perfectly insane that it just had to be on this top. Even though it is a movie top. Yeah. Watch it and you'll understand.</p>
